/**
 * @brief An event passed between the GUI thread, the audio thread and the
 *        message queue worker thread (TAudioThreadMessageQueueThread).
 *
 * rtTask runs in the audio thread. guiCallback, despite its name, does NOT run
 * in the GUI thread: it runs in the message queue worker thread, after the
 * audio thread processed rtTask (or directly, for events posted by the audio
 * thread via post_to_gui_thread()).
 *
 * guiCallback may therefore only:
 * - free plain memory that nobody else references any more (this keeps freeing
 *   out of both the audio thread and the GUI thread)
 * - emit signals; Qt delivers them queued to receivers living in the GUI thread
 *
 * It must not call GUI or model functions directly, and must not delete
 * QObjects that live in the GUI thread. Such objects have to be deleted in the
 * GUI thread, e.g. by calling deleteLater() on them.
